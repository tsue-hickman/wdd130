                    Hi, My name is Tayler Sue Hickman, and I go by "Tayler Sue" as a double name, kind of similar to Mary Kate or something like that.
                    One thing I particularly like about myself is how I laugh outloud all the time at random in public, and if I hear a song that I like in any local store, I will bust-a-move. 
                    My major is Web Development and I am barely entering my Sophomore year of college.
                    I'm excited to meet everyone and look forward to progressing in the course. 
                </p>
